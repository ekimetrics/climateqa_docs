- ClimateQ&A welcomes community contributions. To participate, head over to [the Community Tab on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ekimetrics/climate-question-answering/discussions) and create a "New Discussion" to ask questions and share your insights.
- Provide feedback through email, letting us know which insights you found accurate, useful, or not. Your input will help us improve the platform.
- Only a few sources (see below) are integrated (all IPCC, IPBES), if you are a climate science researcher and need to sift through another report, please let us know.
