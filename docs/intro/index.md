# About ClimateQ&A

## What is ClimateQ&A ?

Climate change and environmental disruptions have become some of the most pressing challenges facing our planet today. As global temperatures rise and ecosystems suffer, it is essential for individuals to understand the gravity of the situation in order to make informed decisions and advocate for appropriate policy changes.

However, comprehending the vast and complex scientific information can be daunting, as the scientific consensus references, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, span thousands of pages. To bridge this gap and make climate science more accessible, we introduce ClimateQ&A as a tool to distill expert-level knowledge into easily digestible insights about climate science.


:::tip[How does ClimateQ&A work?]

ClimateQ&A harnesses modern OCR techniques to parse and preprocess IPCC reports. By leveraging state-of-the-art question-answering algorithms, ClimateQ&A is able to sift through the extensive collection of climate scientific reports and identify relevant passages in response to user inquiries. Furthermore, the integration of the ChatGPT API allows ClimateQ&A to present complex data in a user-friendly manner, summarizing key points and facilitating communication of climate science to a wider audience.
